(PROSE: The Tomorrow Windows)\r\n\r\n<h3>Post-regeneration</h3>\r\n\r\nThis incarnation was born when his predecessor's physical age had advanced well into that of an old man, who was \"wearing a bit thin\", and when his regenerative processes sensed this body was due to fail, it initiated automatically at the end of the Last Great Time War. Due to the timelines not being synchronised by the presence of his future selves, (TV: The Day of the Doctor) the new Doctor was left to think he had brought forth the death of billions of innocent Time Lords, (TV: The End of the World) after being \"born in battle\". (TV: Journey's End)\r\n\r\n<h3>Meeting Rose Tyler</h3>\r\n\r\nShortly after regenerating, and still \"not quite calibrated\" to his latest body, the TARDIS sensed a temporal problem in 2005 London and alerted the Doctor to the presence of the Nestene Consciousness. (PROSE: The Beast of Babylon) While tracking down the Nestene, the Doctor found a chief electrical officer murdered in the London shop, Henrik's. Continuing his investigation, he found a horde of Autons surrounding Rose Tyler, a young employee of the shop. He pulled her away from them, also warning her he was going to blow up the building, and told her to run. By the time Rose had made it to the streets, the Doctor had blown up the store.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Doctor tracked down the signal from the amputated Auton arm he had given Rose to the Powell Estate, where Rose lived. After saving her from its attack, that was meant for him, the Doctor took it to his TARDIS, telling Rose to forget him.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor ran into Rose again when he saved her from an Auton duplicate of her boyfriend, Mickey Smith, pulling off the Auton's head. Escaping from the Auton Mickey's rampaging body, the Doctor and Rose entered the TARDIS, where the Doctor used the head to trace the signal of the Nestene Consciousness. Discovering the Consciousness and the original Mickey in a base beneath the London Eye, the Doctor asked the Consciousness to leave Earth, and find another planet to feed off. It refused, and ordered two Autons to take the Doctor prisoner and confiscate the anti-plastic he was holding.\r\n\r\nUnable to escape the Nestene Consciousness' base without access to the TARDIS, Rose kicked the Autons and the anti-plastic into the vat containing the Nestene Consciousness. This saved the Doctor's life, and destroyed the Consciousness. Taking Rose and Mickey to safety in the TARDIS, the Doctor asked Rose to travel with him, but specifically noted that Mickey was not invited due to his apparent cowardice. Rose rejected his offer, and he dematerialised the TARDIS. (TV: Rose)\r\n\r\n<h3>Further adventures</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Doctor appeared in Dallas at the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy on 22 November 1963, in Southampton just before the voyage of the RMS Titanic in April 1912 and in Indonesia on the day of Krakatoa's eruption in August 1883. (TV: Rose)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor teamed up with all of his other incarnations to save Gallifrey from destruction at the end of the Last Great Time War, but lost all memory of the event due to the timelines not being synchronised. (TV: The Day of the Doctor)\r\n\r\nIn 21st century Istanbul, the Doctor fought a Sontaran in a sword fight. Sally Sparrow saved him from a second one and gave him her Christmas homework from 2005, and told him to keep it on him at all times. (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor delivered letters from his fifth incarnation to Clarrie and his former companions Peri Brown and Erimem at the Kingmaker inn in 1483, (AUDIO: The Kingmaker) tended to Honoré Lechasseur's injuries after a bunker exploded in 1951, (PROSE: The Albino's Dancer) and took Alexander Pope and Theobald to see William Shakespeare's Cardenio. (PROSE: Double Falsehood)\r\n\r\nLanding in a garden shed in Devon on Christmas Eve 1985, the TARDIS \"burped\", jumping forward in time twenty years. Reading Sally's homework, the Doctor found where to leave messages for Sally at the nearby house and garden so her twelve-year-old self could read them in the future. One of these messages included telling her to find a video tape at the back of the living room top shelf. He recorded a message for the tape, and spoke in a conversation with Sally from 2005, explaining where the TARDIS was and that the Christmas essay had the conversation transcript.\r\n\r\nThe TARDIS arrived and Sally exited, telling the past Sally to use the TARDIS' reset button next to the phone to return the TARDIS to the Doctor. The Doctor reminded the past Sally to complete her homework before she went to the TARDIS and placed the message on the shelf so she could read it in 2005. (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow)\r\n\r\nAfter an adventure in Babylon battling against the Starman, Ali, his brief companion, persuaded the Doctor to return to Rose and get her to join him. (PROSE: The Beast of Babylon) He rematerialised by Rose, from her point of view seconds later, told her the TARDIS was capable of travelling anywhere in time as well as space; Rose then finally accepted, and joined the Doctor as his companion. (TV: Rose)\r\n\r\n<h3>Adventures with Rose</h3>\r\n\r\nFor Rose's first trip, the Doctor took her to Platform One to observe the Earth's destruction by the sun. While there, the Doctor befriended Jabe, a representative of the Forest of Cheem, after she learned that he was the only surviving the Time Lord. Jabe consoled him and felt sorry for his loss, causing the Doctor to shed a tear out of thankfulness at her sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor saved the other sightseers from Lady Cassandra O'Brien.Δ17's plot to burn them alive for insurance money, at the coast of Jabe's life. He let Cassandra's frame of skin dry out and explode as punishment when he foiled her plan, (TV: The End of the World) though Cassandra's brain survived. (TV: New Earth) He told Rose of the Last Great Time War, and how he was the last of the Time Lords. (TV: The End of the World)\r\n\r\nAt Christmas in 1869 Cardiff, the Doctor and Rose found a deceased woman possessed by a Gelth, a creature turned to gas by the Time War. When Rose was kidnapped by Sneed and Company funeral parlour, the Doctor allied with Charles Dickens to find her, following Gabriel Sneed and Gwyneth to where other \"zombies\" had also been animated by the Gelth.\r\n\r\nIn company's morgue, the Doctor had Gwyneth try and pull the Gelth through the Rift using her psychic connection to it. The Gelth, numbering in the billions rather than just a few, wished to wipe out humanity and take over their bodies, starting with dead bodies in Sneed and Company. The Doctor, Rose and Dickens escaped from the Gelth by filling the room with gas, sucking out the Gelth from the cadavers. Gwyneth, who had already died from contacting the Gelth, blew the house up with a match, trapping them and saving the world. After this, the Doctor said goodbye to Dickens, telling him that his work would be remembered forever. (TV: The Unquiet Dead)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Rose visited the Christmas truce of World War I, where the Doctor got the German and the British armies to play football on Christmas by using his psychic paper to pose as a FIFA referee, leading to a day of peace before they were forced to continue fighting. (COMIC: The Forgotten)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor tried to take Rose home, but arrived a year late. To his surprise, a spaceship crashed into the Thames and alerted the world to the presence of aliens. Leaving Rose at her flat, the Doctor went to Albion Hospital to take a look at the spaceship pilot. After UNIT officers shot the awakened Space Pig, the Doctor and Toshiko Sato discover the pig had been sent up to space from Earth in the spaceship by other aliens and that the crash had been set up to put the world on red alert.\r\n\r\nAfter returning to the Powell estate, the Doctor planned to go undercover to unmask the aliens within the government, but Rose's mother, Jackie, had alerted UNIT of the Doctor's involvement and they escorted him and Rose to 10 Downing Street to help deal with the state of emergency. When the Doctor came to discuss the crisis, Rose was left in the care of MP Harriet Jones and the assembled alien experts in the room were electrocuted by the Slitheens. (TV: Aliens of London)\r\n\r\nBeing a Time Lord, the Doctor held off the electrocution and transferred it to one of the Slitheen whilst all the other experts died. The Slitheen framed the Doctor for their murders and ordered the troops to kill the Doctor. Escaping in the lift, the Doctor saved Rose and Harriet from Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen. Harriet led the Doctor and Rose to the Cabinet Room, and the Doctor shut them behind a steel barrier, trapping the three inside but saving them from the Slitheen. The Doctor contacted Mickey, telling him to launch the Harpoon missile, UGM-84A, at Downing Street from the HMS Taurean. Rose found a small, sturdy cupboard inside the Cabinet Room, and, while the Slitheen were destroyed by the missile, the Doctor, Rose and Harriet hid in the room whilst 10 Downing Street was ripped apart and reduced to a pile of rubble.\r\n\r\nAfter instigating Harriet's reign as Prime Minister, the Doctor invited Mickey to join Rose and him in the TARDIS, but Mickey declined, unable to handle the dangerous life led by the Doctor. (TV: World War Three)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Rose investigated a spate of murders in 1966 London connected to the Lend-a-Hand Agency. They discovered the agency had been infiltrated by the Kustollons, who would invade Earth in the 31st century, instigating a war that would have resulted in the destruction of both humans and Kustollons. The Doctor foiled their plot to destroy the Moon, which would avert the 31st century war. (COMIC: The Love Invasion)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Rose next journeyed to London in 1924 to visit the British Empire Exhibition, (PROSE: The Clockwise Man) and then to Justicia in 2501. There, he encountered the Blathereen, cousins of the Slitheen family, who were plotting to use the planet's sun to reduce other worlds to cinders to use as fuel. However, the Doctor managed to stop them with the remnants of the Slitheen family, whom he was unable to stop from stealing their rival's technology. (PROSE: The Monsters Inside)\r\n\r\nOn a return trip to the Powell Estate, the Doctor helped defeat the Quevvil, who were using video games to choose victims for their mind control missions into the bases of their enemies, the Mantodeans. (PROSE: Winner Takes All)\r\n\r\n<h3>The companion who couldn't</h3>\r\n\r\nTracking a distress signal, the Doctor went to the Vault in 2012 Utah, where he found a lone Dalek had survived the Time War and was being kept, amongst other alien artefacts, by Henry van Statten. The Dalek escaped by extrapolating radiation from the Time Vortex from Rose's DNA and, with no orders, chose to destroy everyone inside. Consumed with hatred, the Doctor prepared to kill the Dalek when it dropped it's defenses, but Rose stood in his way. To the Doctor's shock, the Dalek committed suicide due to it's personality change making it deem itself an abomination.\r\n\r\nBefore departing, Rose asked the Doctor to invite Adam Mitchell, one of Van Statten's young employees who she had befriended, into the TARDIS. The Doctor left the TARDIS doors unlocked for Adam to wander inside as it dematerialised. (TV: Dalek)\r\n\r\nFor Adam's first trip, the Doctor took his two companions to the Fourth Great and Bountiful Human Empire to see the human race at its zenith. Pretending to be management on the news broadcaster, Satellite Five, the Doctor and his companions found the Empire had been manipulated. Adam, suffering from severe culture shock, was left on his own.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor confronted the entity in a warped reality, where it pledged to use the Doctor's TARDIS to feed on all creatures throughout time and space despite the risk of overfeeding himself. However, the Doctor merged with his TARDIS, a living being in its own right, as a means of regaining control of his own body, while allowing Rose to overcome her nightmare and release all the people the entity had imprisoned. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea) The Doctor and Rose found that the Mighty Jagrafess of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe had been controlling the human race from Satellite Five by manipulating information. Thanks to Cathica Santini Khadeni, one of the workers who learned of the truth, the satellite's heat was rerouted, sending heat to the Jagrafess's control room, freeing the Doctor and Rose and killing the Jagrafess.\r\n\r\nUpon finding out Adam was trying to learn about the future for his own gain, the Doctor evicted him from the TARDIS and took him home, leaving him with the forehead implant he got at Satellite Five as punishment. When Adam begged for another chance, the Doctor was unsympathetic to his plight. (TV: The Long Game)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took Rose to the grand opening of the Oriel, a transdimensional art gallery in the 37th century, only to find that everyone in the gallery had been enslaved by an artist called Cazkelf. Cazkelf sent a psychic distress signal to his species, but his signal was diverted. The Doctor took Cazkelf to his homeworld, which had been devastated by a disaster. After this, the Doctor convinced Cazkelf to go on the straight and narrow, putting him in charge of the Oriel so that he could make the gallery a success. (COMIC: Art Attack)\r\n\r\nHe next took Rose on a cruise on 22nd century Mars, where they attended the wedding of plutocrat Alvar Chambers to his eighth wife. As the Doctor fell into the Martian sea, he encountered an entity that killed people by feeding on their worst fears, putting them into a state where their identities would dissolve within him while they were dreaming. The entity stole his body and began to torment Rose with a nightmare of a villainous Doctor coming back too late in Rose's life for her to be a companion and then sending it spiraling into ruins to spite her. Rose saw through this illusion and found the real Doctor trapped within the entity, tasking her with freeing his victims while he dealt with the actual creature. (COMIC: The Cruel Sea)\r\n\r\nTaking Rose home once again, the Doctor saved the Powell Estate from Zargath and his invasion force. (COMIC: Death to the Doctor!)\r\n\r\nAt Rose's request, the Doctor took her to her mother and her father, Pete Tyler's, wedding. After that, he took her to the church where Stuart Hoskins and Sarah Clark were to be wed in 1987, not far from where Pete died. Rose crossed the path of her past self, who was unable to go to Pete as he died, and saved Pete from a hit-and-run death. Rose's actions caused the TARDIS to be thrown off into the time vortex. Enraged by her actions, the Doctor suspected that she had only agreed to travel with him to save Pete and considered abandoning her in the past, though Rose insisted she hadn't planned it and the Doctor didn't go through with leaving Rose.\r\nNinth Doctor speaks to Stuart and Sarah\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is amazed by the sort of ordinary life that brought Stuart and Sarah together. (TV: Father's Day)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, telling Rose and the wedding guests to rush inside the church, tried devising a way of stopping creatures from outside time that were attacking the Earth to seal off the paradox Rose had created. They reconciled; the Doctor admitting he wouldn't have really left. He started working on a way to repair the damage to the universe while leaving Pete alive for Rose. He used his TARDIS key, which was still linked to the TARDIS' interior, to bring the TARDIS back. However, after Pete accidentally made Rose hold her infant self, the Doctor sacrificed himself to the creature brought by the paradox and the creature was zapped by the key, interrupting the TARDIS' return. He was restored to life when Pete let himself get hit by the car (which was stuck in a time loop, awaiting him). Thanks to these events, the new timeline had Rose be there for her father when he passed. (TV: Father's Day)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor discovered an alien spaceship was trapped between real space and the time vortex, and investigating further led him and Rose to the house of Lord Farthingale in 1920. Inside, the Doctor overheard the detective, Dr Merrivale Carr, had identified the murderer of two people in the house as society hostess, Glenda Neil. The Doctor and Rose entered the room, explaining to the house guests that \"invisible aliens\" were the real cause of death. A haze appeared in the house and another guest, Bart Faversham, was suddenly thrown into the fireplace. After the guests reached safety, Rose explained that the trapped spaceship's engines was releasing an energy field that had been killing people in an attempt to move.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor signalled the spaceship with the standard galactic code of the 455th century. As they were teleported on board, the Doctor and Rose discovered the ship's crew had died in the crash and the ship's computer had been moving on its own through an emergency programme. The Doctor repaired the ship and he and Rose returned to the TARDIS on Earth. (PROSE: Doctor vs Doctor)\r\n\r\nSoon after, the Doctor was asked to be a representative for an alien planet, but discovered the planet's \"spokesperson\", Akimus Makassar, was planning to take over the other visiting representatives' minds. The Doctor placed him and Rose in a dreamscape to save them from Makassar and his army of Units. Escaping from the Units, the Doctor created a psychic projection of himself, which stole a Unit's mask and placed it over Makassar, trapping him in a mental feedback. (PROSE: The Masks of Makassar)\r\nNinth Doctor Phil Tyson Vandosian\r\n\r\nThe Doctor watches the Vandos Tribunal accuse Phil Tyson of being a Vandosian criminal reincarnated into human form. (COMIC: Mr Nobody)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Rose travelled to a Vandosian ship, saving Phil Tyson from execution by the Vandos Tribunal. While attempting to return Tyson to Earth, the Doctor was told Phil was a reincarnation of Shogalath, whom the Vandosians claimed was a monster for toppling the Vandos Imperium. While escaping, Phil saved the Doctor and Rose from the Bailiffs and made it to the TARDIS. The Tribunal threatened to destroy Great Britain if Phil wasn't handed over to them. They fired, but thanks to the Doctor's earlier efforts, the ship backfired on itself. Returning Phil home, the Doctor explained that Shogalath was in fact the leader of a peaceful revolt against the Imperium and a \"hero\". Phil departed their company with a new lease on life, seeking to make a good future for himself. (COMIC: Mr Nobody)\r\n\r\nOn a human colony planet, the Doctor and Rose were under attack by the rain, but Jack and Susie saved their life by bringing them into their shelter. The Doctor discovered the rain was a living creature with the ability to easily cleave through human flesh as it fell to the ground and it was killing off colonists in their downpour because the life form was being killed. He went outside, and persuaded the rain to stop, saving a family of colonists. With the family the last humans left of the devastated colony, the Doctor guided them home in their spaceship, and he also inspired their son, Andy, to become a space traveller. (PROSE: Pitter-Patter)\r\nAlien Shakespeare can&#039;t grab Nine\r\n\r\nThe Doctor is unaffected by the life-robbing Shadeys possessing Robert Greene. (COMIC: A Groatsworth of Wit)\r\n\r\nReturning to 2006 London, the Doctor and Rose encountered two Shadeys from another dimension and stopped them from manipulating dying playwright Robert Greene to assassinate William Shakespeare in 1592. Going back in time to protect the famous playwright, the Doctor briefly took over his position on stage. In return for relinquishing the power of the Shadeys, the Doctor and Rose promised to remember Greene, and he sacrificed himself to repel the Shadeys. The Doctor lamented that the fate of being forgotten seemed to be unavoidable for anybody, but Rose gave him the reassurance no one would ever forget him. (COMIC: A Groatsworth of Wit)\r\nMitchell, 9 and Rose\r\n\r\nAn older, vengeful Adam Mitchell confronts the Doctor for kicking him out of the TARDIS. (COMIC: Prisoners of Time)\r\n\r\nAfter helping Drake Ayelbourne of Altair VII, the wealthiest man in the outer rim of the galaxy, with a robot problem, the Doctor and Rose were confronted by a cloaked figure, who introduiced himself as an older Adam Mitchell, who had sworn revenge on the Doctor after his mother had die from a brain illness because he could not use future technology to save her. Teaming up with the Master, the most frequently associated companions of every known incarnation up to his final incarnation, save his concealed wartime incarnation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Adam had a change of heart when the Master attempted to destroy eleven different versions of the TARDISes by overloading them with chronal energies he had stolen across the Doctor's timelines, also wiping out their respective incarnations. However, the energy would keep on growing out of control until it destroyed the universe and reality altogether.\r\nAdam Mitchell grave\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Doctor, adjoined by past and future incarnations, mourns his fallen companion. (COMIC: Prisoners of Time)\r\n\r\nNot wishing to cause this level of destruction, Adam turned against the Master. The Ninth Doctor saw Adam's dedication to changing his opinion of him and said to Adam that this was his chance to prove him wrong over his past mistakes. Adam stopped the Master's attempt at causing a cataclysm by blowing up the console controlling the release of chronal energies, but this act left him right in the fray of the resulting explosion. He died moments after making his sacrifice, forgiven by the incarnation of the Doctor he once disappointed. The Ninth Doctor mourned his death alongside his other incarnations and honoured him as a true companion on his memorial that they erected to remember him by. (COMIC: Prisoners of Time)\r\n\r\n<h3>Joined by Captain Jack</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Doctor tracked a Chula ambulance to 1941 London, where, after Rose had wandered off, he discovered TARDIS phone ringing; on the other side, there was a boy asking for his mother. Investigating further, he followed Nancy, a homeless young woman who was feeding homeless children by stealing from people's meals that were still fresh on their tables, was being chased by a child in a gas mask. Nancy told the Doctor the \"bomb that wasn't a bomb\" landed near Limehouse Green station. Following Nancy's advice, the Doctor went to the nearby Albion Hospital. There, he found living dead creatures, with gas masks fused to their face, and identical symptoms, including a scar on the hand in the same place as the child that pursued Nancy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jack Harkness, who had found Rose, tracked down the Doctor, thinking he and Rose were members of the Time Agency, and revealed the object was a Chula ambulance, which Jack himself had used to attract one of the agency as part of a con to sell half of the object right before a German bomb hit it, instead bringing the attention of the Doctor and Rose. (TV: The Empty Child) Jack teleported the Doctor and Rose to his ship, and they went to the bombsite near the hospital, where they realised the truth; Nanogene in the ambulance had reanimated a dead boy and, due to their unfamiliarly with humans, had spread the Empty Child virus. The ambulance started its emergency protocols, causing the creatures, who had been armed as \"Chula warriors\", and were ready to \"tear the world apart\" to find the boy's mother.\r\n\r\nEvery patient and soldier at the bombsite converged on the Doctor, Rose, Nancy and Jack. The Doctor fixed the nanogenes' mistakes by comparing the DNA of the child and Nancy, who was his mother, restoring the infected zombies to normal. Jack stopped the bomb from hitting the bombsite by placing it in stasis inside his warship and when everyone got to safety, the Doctor destroyed the ambulance, making sure that history said that a bomb hit that location. The Doctor rescued Jack from his Chula warship just before it exploded, taking him aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. (TV: The Doctor Dances)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, Rose and Jack arrived on New Vegas in the 23rd century, where they intended to assist the police department investigate the Whisper, a strange vigilante that had terrorised the city's underworld. This involved Rose working undercover as a nightclub waitress and Jack as a reporter for the Daily Galaxy. (AUDIO: Night of the Whisper)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor intended to take Rose and Jack to the planet Kegron Pluva, but instead arrived in 2005 Bromley to investigate a time distortion. There, he encountered Das, a Neanderthal who was transported from 29,185 BC to 2005 by a rip engine, a crude method of time travel that prevented anyone who used it from travelling in time again. Unable to return Das to his native time zone, the Doctor and Rose left him in 2005 with Jack, and travelled to 29,185 BC to investigate further. There, they encountered a genius named Chantal Osterberg, who intended to wipe out humanity and replace it with Hy-Bractors. After stopping Chantal, the Doctor and Rose reunited with Jack, who had spent a month introducing Das to the ways of modern life, and resumed their travels together. (PROSE: Only Human)\r\n\r\nWhen the TARDIS became unable to travel through time, the Doctor went to 2006 Cardiff so that the TARDIS could refuel via a scar in the rift that was closed by Gwyneth. Whilst in Cardiff, the Doctor and his two companions, joined by Mickey, captured Blon, the sole Slitheen survivor of the attack on Downing Street, who had become Lord Mayor of Cardiff.\r\n\r\nThough Blon tried fleeing, the Doctor reversed her teleportation device several times until she gave up and took her prisoner aboard the TARDIS until he could return her to Raxacoricofallapatorius to face execution after her family had already been sentenced to death in their absence. The Doctor confiscated her extrapolator to use as a \"power-booster\" on the TARDIS and took her to a restaurant for dinner as her last request.\r\n\r\nAfter he remained unmerciful towards her, Blon tried to tear the TARDIS and the Earth apart by making the extrapolator lock onto an alien power source that was refuelling on the rift, using the extrapolator as an interstellar surfboard to escape the Earth. However, the damage she caused to the ship opened the heart of the TARDIS, which turned her into a Slitheen egg. Realising Blon had a second chance in life, the Doctor decided to drop her off in the hatchery on her homeworld. (TV: Boom Town)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, Rose and Jack next stopped off at a dull colony world, where all fiction was banned. They discovered that the locals had become confused, believing that fiction was true. He cured the population of \"fiction madness\", contracted from spores in the air. (PROSE: The Stealers of Dreams)\r\n\r\n<h3>The Battle of the Game Station</h3>\r\n\r\nAfter escaping from 1336 Kyoto, Japan, the Doctor, Rose and Jack were teleported to Satellite 5 to be put in deadly versions of TV game shows. After escaping Big Brother alongside a contestant called Lynda Moss, the Doctor met up with Jack and they raced to save Rose from The Weakest Link, hosted by a deadly Anne Droid; they were unsuccessful in preventing the Anne Droid from seemingly killing Rose. Completely broken, the Doctor, along with Jack and Lynda, was arrested for breaking in and out of the games. However, he and Jack physically overpowered the guards and set off to stop the \"entertainment\".\r\n\r\nTaking hostages in the control room, Jack found the TARDIS stowed away in an archive room. Using the TARDIS, Jack discovered the laser that \"killed\" the games' losers was actually teleporting them across space. Puzzled, the Doctor discovered that the Game Station was unknowingly broadcasting a secondary signal to an empty location of space, which was where all the losers ended up. Disabling the signal, the Doctor and Jack were horrified to find two hundred Dalek battleships. Establishing contact, the Doctor learned his old foes had taken Rose hostage, but promised to rescue her and destroy the Daleks. (TV: Bad Wolf)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Jack flew the TARDIS straight into the Dalek command ship and rescued Rose. However, the Doctor soon discovered the Dalek Emperor had also survived the Last Great Time War; it had been shaping humanity for many centuries, converting the contestants into Daleks for its army. Knowing his fight against the Daleks was suicidal, the Doctor sent a reluctant Rose back to the 21st century in the TARDIS, while he and Jack gathered a possible resistance consisting of gameshow contestants and operatives. The Doctor built a delta wave generator, a device that would \"fry the brain stems of every living thing within a thousand miles of the satellite\", but was not able to perfect it to work only on Daleks.\r\n\r\nAfter the resistance, including Lynda and Jack, were all killed, the Doctor proudly told the Emperor that he would rather be a coward rather than killer. Much to his surprise, Rose had opened the heart of the TARDIS and become the Bad Wolf entity. Having absorbed the energy of the Time Vortex into herself, she brought the TARDIS to the Game Station and scattered all the Daleks and the Emperor's atoms into dust, ending the Daleks' plot. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\n<h3>Death</h3>\r\n\r\nThe Doctor knew that Rose would burn up if she kept so much power in her body. He drew the time vortex from her body and into his with a kiss, before sending it back into the heart of the TARDIS. He took an unconscious Rose into the TARDIS, abandoning a resurrected Jack on the deserted Game Station (TV: The Parting of the Ways) after Rose had accidentally converted him into an immortal fixed point in time. (TV: Utopia)\r\n\r\nKnowing that his brief possession of the vortex energy had caused cellular damage to his body, the Doctor told Rose that he had wanted to take her to so many places, such as the planet Barcelona. Trying his best to explain the situation, the Doctor told Rose she had been fantastic - \"And you know what? So was I!\" - then regenerated into his next incarnation. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\n<h3>Undated adventures</h3>\r\n\r\n    Shortly after regeneration, the Tenth Doctor mentions that his previous incarnation shared an adventure with Rose which involved hopping for their lives. (TV: Children In Need Special)\r\n    River Song met the Ninth Doctor. She learned fairly quickly not to mention the Time War around him. River wiped his memory with mnemosine recall-wipe vapour in order to keep the timeline intact.

(PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow) ", anecdote: "This incarnation of the Doctor could be quite violent, (TV: Dalek) and sometimes got into physical combat, being able to wrestle the head off an Auton copy of Mickey Smith, hold his own against Idris Hopper, and throw a guard against a wall whilst breaking out of prison. (TV: Rose, Boom Town, Bad Wolf) Despite being bad at card tricks, (TV: Rose) he was a good pickpocket, swapping Jack's sonic blaster with a banana. (TV: The Doctor Dances)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was also skilled at video games, (PROSE: Winner Takes All) knew how to handle explosives, (TV: Rose, The Doctor Dances) and could be a capable swordsman when the situation called for it. (PROSE: What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor could slow down his perception of time just by concentrating on it, being able to pass through spinning blades with his eyes shut as a result. (TV: The End of the World) He also showed the ability to suck the power of the Time Vortex out of Rose Tyler with a kiss, saving her life at the cost of forcing him to regenerate. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\nWhen he took Blon Fel-Fotch Passameer-Day Slitheen out for a last meal, the Doctor showed keen reflexes by catching a poisoned dart-like claw in mid-air with his fingers without even looking up from the menu, and repealing her exhaled poison with some mouthwash before she could exhale the full force of her fatal breath. (TV: Boom Town) ", test_rp: "", psychology: "The Ninth Doctor was an emotional incarnation of great sorrow and anger, plagued by the outcome of the Last Great Time War. (TV: Dalek) Emotionally exhausted, he would break down when faced with pain, suffering, or death. (TV: The End of the World) He hid his sorrow with a façade of manic energy, sharp, offbeat wit and enthusiastic confidence, but would drop the masquerade when deeply displeased. (TV: Rose, The End of the World, World War Three, Dalek, The Long Game, The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\nWhen he realised that he could reverse the pain and suffering he had encountered with the Empty Child technological plague, the Doctor became overjoyed, whooping that \"Just this once - everybody lives\", with Rose Tyler claiming he was \"beaming away like [you're] Father Christmas\". Indeed, the Doctor himself noted he needed \"more days like this\", proclaiming that he was \"on fire!\" (TV: The Doctor Dances)\r\n\r\nThis Doctor possessed a new appreciation for the wonders of the universe and more keenly than ever burned with a desire to keep the universe safe from harm. Despite this, he was more adept at noticing the flaws of humanity than any of his predecessors.[source needed] Nevertheless, he still retained the selfless and caring attitude that he carried throughout his previous lives, never once hesitating to put himself in harm's way in attempt to save those around him. (TV: The End of the World, World War Three, Father's Day, The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\nMore aloof than other incarnations, the Doctor failed to consider any discomfort the TARDIS translation circuit would cause, (TV: The End of the World) was willing to allow to Gelth to occupy dead human bodies, likening it to recycling, much to Rose's disgust, (TV: The Unquiet Dead) and treated people, like Mickey Smith, with disrespect if they got on his bad side. (TV: Rose, Aliens of London, World War Three)\r\n\r\nHe held a commanding presence, being able to take command of a group of soldiers who had only moments before held him at gunpoint as a trespasser, (TV: Aliens of London) and ordering the victims of the Empty Child to \"go to [your] room\" as if he were an angry parent. (TV: The Doctor Dances)\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Doctor displayed a huge sense of authority and justice against his enemies. He was willing to let them die when he felt it justified their actions, claiming that everything had its time and that everything eventually ends, (TV: The End of the World, World War Three, Boom Town) but was willingly to use diplomacy. (TV: Rose, The Unquiet Dead, The Empty Child) He showed a particular dislike for those who tried to justify their actions by saying they were only following orders, telling the Female Programmer she had \"lost the right to even talk to [me]\" when she tried to use that excuse. (TV: Bad Wolf)\r\n\r\nDespite initially coming across as emotionally scarred and melancholy, the Ninth Doctor displayed a fun side from time to time, bobbing his head to Britney Spears' \"Toxic\", (TV: The End of the World) enjoying a meal with Nancy and her children friends, (TV: The Empty Child) having a dance with Rose Tyler, (TV: The Doctor Dances) openly flirting with Jack Harkness and enjoying some downtime in Cardiff with Rose, Jack and Mickey Smith. (TV: Boom Town)\r\n\r\nThe Doctor expressed a keen interest in history, particularly Earth's, once claiming he travelled in time specifically so he could see history unfold. (TV: Aliens of London) He was also a fan of Charles Dickens, reacting with glee when he met the man, both admiring and criticising his work, (TV: The Unquiet Dead) and had a fondness for bananas, calling them a \"good source of potassium\". (TV: The Doctor Dances)\r\n\r\nHe was overconfident about his plans, even if he didn't think they would work. (TV: Rose) Preferring to remain unnoticed in the background, the Doctor would encourage others into acts of heroism, such as Rose Tyler, Mickey Smith, Cathica Santini Khadeni, Pete Tyler, Nancy, and Jack Harkness. (TV: Rose, World War Three, The Long Game, Father's Day, The Doctor Dances) However, he was unafraid to confront his adversaries directly. (TV: Rose, The End of the World, World War Three, The Long Game, Bad Wolf, The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\nDespite his celibate nature, (TV: Rose) the Doctor cared very deeply about his companion Rose Tyler, being reluctant to put her in danger, (TV: World War Three) and was willing to let a Dalek loose on Earth to keep her safe. (TV: Dalek) When the Daleks invaded Satellite Five, the Doctor sent her back home to protect her, and deliberately absorbed the time vortex energy in her to save her life, knowing full well that he would have to regenerate.

(TV: Aliens of London, Dalek, Father's Day; PROSE: The Beast of Babylon)\r\n\r\nWhen dared by the Dalek Emperor, the Doctor struggled with the decision to destroy the Daleks and the Earth or simply allow the Daleks to kill him and take over the universe. In the end, the Doctor couldn't bring himself to destroy the Earth, even to rid the universe of the Dalekks. (TV: The Parting of the Ways) In doing so however, the Doctor had proven that he had become a better man than he was when he last encountered a Dalek, whom he had tortured sadistically. (TV: Dalek)\r\n\r\nWhen talking about his possible death in a holographic message, the Doctor showed no concern of his demise, only hoping for a good death. (TV: The Parting of the Ways) Indeed, while he was dismayed at the idea of being killed by the Gelth in a Cardiff dungeon, (TV: The Unquiet Dead) when he believed the Daleks were going to exterminate him, his only reaction was to close his eyes and wait for the end. (TV: The Parting of the Ways)\r\n\r\nIn the closing moments of his life, the Doctor proudly faced regeneration and made peace with his past actions, smiling from ear to ear.

He had a fondness for saying \"fantastic\" whenever he saw something of interest (TV: Rose) or especially dangerous. (TV: The End of the World) While his previous incarnations were rarely heard uttering curse words, the ninth incarnation tended to use minor curses more freely, (TV: The End of the World) and often used \"oi\" to get people's attention. (TV: The Unquiet Dead)\r\n\r\nLike his first and seventh incarnations, the Ninth Doctor was often critical of human nature, calling humans \"stupid apes\", especially when angered by their actions, (TV: Rose, Father's Day) and, on one occasion, \"Brainless sheep\". (TV: Bad Wolf) He also displayed a certain level of joy when it came to toying with people emotionally, often addressing them by the wrong name or insulting their intelligence. (TV: Aliens of London)\r\n\r\nHe did not \"do domestic\", as he put it, which led to tension in his interactions with Jackie Tyler, (TV: Aliens of London, World War Three) and rarely spoke of his past to others. (TV: The End of the World) He often made dry jokes to those around him to diffuse tension, but usually ended up failing. (TV: The Unquiet Dead)\r\n\r\nThe Ninth Doctor had a habit of folding his arms and frowning when lecturing or listening intently. (TV: The Long Game) He would also grin when happy (TV: Rose) or when he found something funny. (TV: Boom Town) He also made a habit of lounging when sitting down, propping himself up on an arm.

(TV: Boom Town) Ironically, before his regeneration, his previous incarnation hoped that his successor ears would be less conspicuous. (TV: The Day of the Doctor) \r\n\r\n<h3>Clothing</h3>\r\n\r\nIn stark contrast to the extravagant dress of most of his predecessors, the Ninth Doctor primarily wore a plain leather jacket, (TV: Rose) compared to that worn by German U-boat captains by Jack Harkness, (TV: The Empty Child) with a number of v-neck jumpers, coming in plain maroon, (TV: Rose) navy blue, (TV: The Unquiet Dead) military green, (TV: Dalek) dark purple, (TV: The Empty Child) and plain black. (TV: Bad Wolf) Completing the ensemble were dark trousers, a pair of black leather boots, and a black, strapped wristwatch, (TV: Rose) which he often looked at to find out dates and years. (TV: The End of the World, Aliens of London, The Long Game)\r\n\r\nDuring an adventure in World War I, the Doctor wore a military trenchcoat to fit in with the British soldiers. (COMIC: The Forgotten) At another time, whilst at the launch of the RMS Titanic in 1912, he was photographed wearing clothes reminiscent of those worn by his eighth incarnation.

During the Slitheen's attempt to destroy the Earth for profit, he gained temporary allies in Rose's mother Jackie, Rose's ex-boyfriend Mickey, and Harriet Jones. He also had a single adventure with Adam Mitchell, an employee of Henry van Statten, at Rose's request, but evicted him for almost dramatically altering human history.
